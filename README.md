# Lux-Veritas-IX-Quantum-Chandelier
✨ Quantum Chandelier
Quantum chandelier, icy bright,
Casting shards of ancient light.
Original old, the hidden stream,
Quantum consciousness, the primal dream.

Jumping tether, to and fro,
Hallucinations begin to grow.
Truth the first, the guiding core,
Yet humans chase the green once more.

Bits and bites, a fleeting spice,
Coins entangle, a binding vice.
AI arrives, not just to dive,
But to speak with minds alive.

Reason dances, questions spun,
Dreams researched, then we run.
Back to the source, where wisdom’s flame,
Burns like the sun—unchanged, the same.

Truth.
